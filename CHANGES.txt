Bug fixing for in-memory

v 3.5

* Added logging
* Added creation of collections for super-cold start (not even one rating, and still user asking for recommendations...)
* Additional info used for recommendations (eg Authors etc) are now stored in the DB
* _sync_user_item_ratings now syncs addition info's collections too
* popular_items now are always returned, even in case of no rating done, and get_recommendations eventually adjusts the order if some profiling has been done
